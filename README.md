# CVGSSL

## The paper "CLIP-Vision Guided Few-Shot Metal Surface Defect Recognition" has been published in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics.


## 🧠 CVGSSL Project  
Metal surface defect recognition (MSDR) based on deep learning encounters the challenge of Few-Shot expert-labeled data. In this study, we proposed a CLIP-Vision Guided Self Supervised Learning (CVGSSL) framework for representation learning of unlabeled data, completing MSDR using Few-Shot labeled data. This framework initially generates rich and diverse representation information through multiple CLIP-Vs to ensure effective SSL pre-training, followed by the design of an MLP-Adapter to distill knowledge and adapt these representations to recognition tasks. Additionally, we constructed a self-constrained loss to address the inherent problem of intra-class and inter-class distance ambiguity that causes the representation to fall into an equivocal decision margin. Following label-free pre-training of CVGSSL, the downstream model adapts to 1-shot to 4-shot defect recognition tasks through fine-tuning.

### 🚀 Getting Started
> ⚠️ **Note**: Please manually download the CLIP checkpoint (e.g., `RN50.pt`) and place it in the `ckp/` folder. Also, create necessary folders like `weight/` and `results/` beforehand, as they are not auto-generated.
#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision timm numpy
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

#### 2. Run the Training Script

```bash
python train.py 
```
#### 3. Run the Finetune Script

```bash
python finetune_lincls.py
```

### 📊 Logging & Output

Training logs are automatically saved under `logs/`. Each run logs per-epoch loss and accuracy for training and testing phases:

```
[Run 1] Epoch [1/100] Train Loss: 1.2593, Acc: 63.42% | Val Loss: 0.9341, Acc: 78.01%
...
[Run 1] Best Val Acc: 81.53%
```
